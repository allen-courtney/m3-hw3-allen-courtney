              <h2>About Gustav Klimt</h2>
              <p>
                Gustav Klimt is an Austraian painter known for his highly decorative style and erotic nature of his works, which were seen as a rebellion against the traditional academic art of his time. His most famous paitings are The Kiss and Potrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer.

                Klimt was born in 1862 in Baumgarten, Austria, not far from Vienna. At 14, Klimt enrolled in Vienna's School of Applied Arts where he studied a range of subjects, including fresco painting and mosaic. Klimt would share that his artwork inspiration came from his predecessor Hans Makart and by the Viennese avent-garde, then later Klimt's inspiration became the psychological inquiry and preoccupation with sexuality that pervaded the Viennese avant-garde. 
                Women had always been Klimt's favorite subjects, "I am less interested in myself as a subject for paiting than I am in other people, above all women," he once said.

                Klimt would go on to create beautiful artwork over the years and pushing artistic boundaries. He later died at age 55, from a stroke.

              <h4>My Favorite Artwork By Klimt</h4>
              <p>
                I love the use of golds and all the colors and feminity in Klimt's artwork. My favorite pieces are The Kiss, Danae, Judith and the Head of Holofernes, Water Snakes II, and the Three Ages of Woman.
